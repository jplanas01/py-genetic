Parallelized implementation of a genetic algorithm orchestrator.

Implementations should inherit the GeneticAlgo class and override the gen_individuals function. The simulation function is passed in as an argument and should take in as a single argument the individual being simulated.
For an example implementation, look at the genetic-linkage-optimizer repo.
